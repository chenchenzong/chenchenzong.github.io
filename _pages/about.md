<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

<!-- <span style="color: blue;">**About Me**</span> -->
<span>**About Me**</span>

I am Chen-Chen Zong, a Ph.D. student at [College of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nuaa.edu.cn/) in [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Sheng-Jun Huang](https://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/huangsj/). 

Prior to my Ph.D. endeavor, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2021 at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/). I was initially enrolled in the Master's program and later transitioned to a Ph.D. program via an integrated M.S.-Ph.D. track in April 2023. I have been fortunate to receive consistent guidance from [Prof. Sheng-Jun Huang](https://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/huangsj/) since 2019.

<span>**Research Interest**</span>

My research interests primarily lie in weakly supervised learning in complex and open environments. I am currently particularly interested in active learning and learning with noisy labels under open-set or federated learning settings.

I am always open to research collaborations! If you are interested, feel free to reach out to me via email.
